# About

Uitsmijter is a versatile OAuth2 authorization server and a Kubernetes Middleware for Traefik.

On one side it provides a flexible and powerful basis for new projects, on the other hand it has been built with the
focus to comfortably bring existing, mostly monolithic applications into the microservice, cloud- and multi-cloud world.

It offers multi-tenant single sign-on via secure, low-maintenance and easy-to-implement middleware, as well as
protocol-compliant OAuth 2.0 authorization workflows. Both processes work hand in hand and, after minimal and
easy-to-understand configuration in a short time after foolproof and fully automated (Infrastructure As Code)
installation.

A company-wide login can be put into operation within the shortest possible time in a vendor-neutral manner and without
data specifications on your user profiles, even without changing the user database. It is important that your data
contents and data structures as well as the data management can be determined by you at any time.

Uitsmijter does not bring its own user data storage, but offers interfaces to use your
existing databases and services in a simple, secure and elegant way.

## Uitsmijter is guided by original RFCs

The original RFC for OAuth 2.0 endpoints is "The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework", which was published
as [RFC 6749](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.html) in October 2012. This RFC defines the overall framework for
OAuth 2.0, including the authorization process, the different grant types (such as authorization code and refresh
token), and the roles of the various actors involved (such as the client, the resource owner, and the authorization
server).

In addition to RFC 6749, there are several other RFCs that define specific aspects of the OAuth 2.0 framework. For
example, [RFC 6750](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6750.html) defines the Bearer Token usage, which specifies how to
use access tokens in HTTP requests.

All information you need to install, configure, run the server, as well as configuring the client libraries are covered
in this documentation. Our goal is to present you everything you need in an understandable language. If you are missing
some aspects, please do not hesitate to [contact us](mailto:sales@uitsmijter.io). We are improving the documentation
constantly. Your feedback is welcome.
