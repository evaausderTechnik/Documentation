# Ingredients for an Uitsmijter

![A delicious Uitsmijter](/resources/uitsmijter-ingredients.jpg "A delicious Uitsmijter")

- 1 teaspoon butter
- 2 large eggs
- 2 slices white bread
- 2 slices shaved boiled ham
- 2 large slices aged Gouda cheese
- Salt and Pepper

First melt the butter in a frying pan or skillet and fry the eggs. Once the bottoms of the eggs are set, take the pan
off the heat, place a lid on the pan and allow the eggs to steam until the top has firmed up. If you prefer your
eggs more thoroughly cooked, flip them over and fry until the yolk is done to your liking.

Lightly toast the bread and place the slices of toast on a plate. Top the toast with ham and cheese and put the
fried eggs on top of it.

Season to taste with salt and pepper.
